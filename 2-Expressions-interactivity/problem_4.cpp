/*Programming Challenges - Problem 4: Math Tutor
Write a program that can be used as a math tutor for a young student. The program should display two random numbers between 1 and 9 to be added.
After the student has entered an answer and pressed the [Enter] key, the program should display the correct answer so the student can see if his or her answer is correct.
