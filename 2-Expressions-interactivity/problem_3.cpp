/*Programming Challenges - Problem 3: male and female percentages
Write a program that asks the user for the number of males and number of females registered in a class. The program should then compute and report what percentage of the students are males and what percentage are females. Convert the decimal result of each calculation to percent form and display it with two decimal points. The two values should add up to 100.00 percent.
