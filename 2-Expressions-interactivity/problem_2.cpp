/*Programming Challenges - Problem 2: Batting Average
Write a program to find a baseball playerâ€™s batting average. The program should ask the user to enter the number of times the player was at bat and the number of hits earned. Display the batting average as a decimal between .000 and 1.000. For example, if a player bats 40 times and gets 10 hits, which is 25% of the time, their batting average would be .250.
