/*Programming Challenges - Problem 1: Sales Prediction

The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total sales. Based on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the East Coast division will generate if the company has $8.6 million in sales this year. Display the result on the screen. */
