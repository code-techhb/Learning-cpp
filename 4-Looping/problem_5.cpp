/*Programming Challenges - Problem 5: Math Tutor V.3
To-dos: 1- Display a menu for different operations and let user pick one. 
The final selection on the menu should let the user quit the program. 
2- Generate two random numbers and ask user to perform computation based on operations they chose in todo 1.
After the user has finished the math problem, the program should display the menu again. This process must repeat until the user chooses to quit the program. If the user selects an item not on the menu, the program should print an error message and then display the menu again.
