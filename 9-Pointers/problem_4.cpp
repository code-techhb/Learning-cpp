/*Programming Challenges - Problem 4: Pie a la Mode
In statistics the mode of a set of values is the value that occurs most often. Write a program that determines how many pieces of pie most people eat in a year. Set up an integer array that can hold responses from 30 people. For each person, enter the number of pieces they say they eat in a year. Then write a function that finds the mode of these 30 values. This will be the number of pie slices eaten by the most people. The function that finds and returns the mode should accept two arguments, an array of integers, and a value indicating how many elements are in the array.
