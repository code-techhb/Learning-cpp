/*Programming Challenges - Problem 3: Book Club Points 
An online book club awards points to its customers based on the number of books purchased each month. Points are awarded as follows:

Books Purchased	Points Earned
0	0
1	5
2	15
3	30
4 or more	50
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of books purchased this month and then displays the number of points awarded.
