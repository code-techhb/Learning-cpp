/*Programming Challenges - Problem 4: February Days
The month of February normally has 28 days. But if it is a leap year, February has 29Â days. Write a program that asks the user to enter a year. The program should then display the number of days in February that year. Use the following criteria to identify leap years:

Determine whether the year is divisible by 100. If it is, then it is a leap year if and if only it is also divisible by 400. For example, 2000 is a leap year but 2100 is not.

If the year is not divisible by 100, then it is a leap year if and if only it is divisible by 4. For example, 2008 is a leap year but 2009 is not.
