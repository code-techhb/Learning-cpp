/*Programming Challenges - Problem 1: Magic dates
The date June 10, 1960, is special because when we write it in the following format, the month times the day equals the year.

6/10/60

Write a program that asks the user to enter a month (in numeric form), a day, and a two-digit year. The program should then determine whether the month times the day is equal to the year. If so, it should display a message saying the date is magic. Otherwise, it should display a message saying the date is not magic. Test your program with some dates that are magic and some that are not.

Input Validation: Think about what legal values the program should accept for month and day.
